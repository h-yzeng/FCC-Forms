This is one of the required projects to earn the Responsive Web Design Certification on FreeCodeCamp.org

This survey form is used to collect data from individuals who want to attend a coding boot camp.

For this project, I built a survey form about a fictional coding boot camp focused on wed development pathways using vanilla HTML and CSS.
